Problem space

Why are we doing this? 

This website is designed to empower women by offering a comprehensive platform for wellness and mental health support. It includes a safety network with emergency contacts and panic button, resources for homemakers to enhance skills and track professional progress, mental health tools like mood tracking and anonymous sharing, and personal growth features such as daily affirmations, habit tracking, and 30-day challenges. Our goal is to create a supportive space where women can prioritize their well-being, grow personally, and find the resources to thrive.

Success will be judged by the impact we have on women's lives, measured through active engagement with the platform's features, such as the use of safety tools, participation in professional growth activities, regular mental health tracking, and involvement in personal development challenges.
